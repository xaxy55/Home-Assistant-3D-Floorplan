# Home Assistant 3D Floorplan

![Home Assistant 3D Floorplan preview](images/preview.png)

A Lovelace custom card for placing Home Assistant entities on a 3D model and rendering physically-based lighting directly in the browser. Load a `.glb`, switch to Edit Mode, select an entity from the sidebar, click the model to place it, then configure lighting zones and light types for a realistic room render.

The card element is `custom:home-assistant-3d-floorplan`.

## Install

Add this JavaScript resource in Home Assistant:

```yaml
url: /local/Home-Assistant-3D-Floorplan.js
type: module
```

If installed through HACS:

```yaml
url: /hacsfiles/Home-Assistant-3D-Floorplan/Home-Assistant-3D-Floorplan.js
type: module
```

## Basic Card

```yaml
type: custom:home-assistant-3d-floorplan
title: 3D Floorplan
model: /local/floorplans/home.glb
view_mode: "3d"
markers: []
```

## Coordinate System

The card uses the standard Three.js / GLTF coordinate convention:

- **X** - east/west floor axis
- **Y** - vertical (height)
- **Z** - north/south floor axis

This matches `.glb` files exported from Blender with the default Y-up orientation. No `coordinate_map` override is needed for standard exports.

## Markers

Marker colors reflect live entity state:

- Red: unavailable or unknown
- Yellow: active / on / open / detected
- Dark: inactive / off / closed / clear
- Green: available neutral state

Default press actions:

```yaml
marker_tap_action: auto
marker_hold_action: auto
edit_marker_tap_action: select
edit_marker_hold_action: move
marker_hold_ms: 650
```

`auto` uses domain defaults - lights and switches toggle on tap; sensors, binary sensors, and climate entities open more-info. Edit Mode is shown only when `hass.user.is_admin === true`.

Markers export as:

```yaml
markers:
  - entity: light.kitchen
    name: Kitchen Light
    icon: mdi:lightbulb
    tap_action: toggle
    hold_action: more-info
    light_intensity: 100
    light_type: spot
    light_radius: 120
    x: 850.0000
    y: 230.0000
    z: 610.0000
```

Temperature and humidity sensors show their live value on the marker. Use **Marker display** in Edit Mode to force icon or value display:

```yaml
marker_display: value   # auto | icon | value
```

### Color Thresholds

Use `color_thresholds` to color a marker dynamically based on its numeric state value. This is particularly useful for temperature, humidity, CO₂, or any sensor with a continuous numeric reading.

```yaml
markers:
  - entity: sensor.living_room_temperature
    name: Living Room
    marker_display: value
    color_thresholds:
      - value: 18
        color: "#42a5f5"   # blue  — cold
      - value: 22
        color: "#66bb6a"   # green — comfortable
      - value: 26
        color: "#ef5350"   # red   — hot
```

**Threshold logic (step, not interpolated):**

- State **below** the first threshold → first threshold color
- State **between** two thresholds → color of the lower threshold
- State **at or above** the last threshold → last threshold color

So for the example above: values below 18 are blue, 18–21.9 are blue, 22–25.9 are green, and 26+ are red.

`color_thresholds` works in both 2D (floorplan image) and 3D model view, and accepts any valid CSS color (`#hex`, `rgb()`, named colors). When the entity is offline or unavailable, the standard red offline styling takes precedence.

In Edit Mode, select a numeric sensor marker and use **Color thresholds** in the marker settings panel to add, edit, or remove threshold rows.

## Edit Mode

Switch to Edit Mode to place and configure markers.

**Sidebar** - lists all HA entities. Placed markers show a **Remove** button. Unplaced markers show **Add**; clicking it then clicking the 3D model places the marker at that surface point.

**Floating panel** - selecting a placed marker opens a panel on the right with:
- Icon picker
- Marker display setting
- Tap / Hold actions
- Light intensity, type, radius, and render parameters (for `light.*` entities in Positional zones)
- XYZ coordinates
- Move / Delete buttons

<img src="images/Marker%20Settings.png" alt="Marker settings panel" width="350" />

**Axes gizmo** - a small XYZ orientation indicator appears in the top-left corner in Edit Mode, showing how the model axes relate to the camera.

**Export YAML** - the sidebar exports the full card YAML with current marker positions, zone definitions, and presets. Press **Copy YAML** to copy it to the clipboard.

## Camera Views

The compass in the corner provides:

- **Top** - straight top-down view
- **N / E / S / W** - 45-degree angled side views

In Edit Mode, **Save Home** stores the current camera position as the startup view. The saved view is stored per-floor and is written to the YAML export:

```yaml
default_view:
  position: [6.2500, 4.5000, 8.7500]
  target: [0.0000, 0.8000, 0.0000]
  zoom: 1.0000
```

## Brightness Areas (Lighting Zones)

Edit Mode can define room polygons that drive the 3D lighting render. Press **Add Area**, then **Draw**, and click the floor to trace the room boundary.

### Lighting Modes

Each zone has two modes, selectable in the zone settings:

**Area (zone-wide glow)** - a single flat ambient fill covers the whole floor polygon. Suitable for zones with diffuse overhead lighting or when no individual light positions are needed.

![Area glow mode](images/Area_Glow.png)

**Positional (per-light pools)** - each `light.*` marker placed inside the zone creates its own floor pool, wall glow, ceiling glow, and GI bounce based on its position and light type.

![Positional lighting mode](images/Positional.png)

### Zone Settings

```yaml
brightness_zones:
  - id: living-room
    name: Living Room
    color: "#f8d66d"
    height: 280
    day_opacity: 0.50
    night_opacity: 1.00
    lighting_mode: positional
    illuminance_enabled: true
    illuminance_entity: sensor.living_room_lux
    show_lux: true
    points:
      - x: 100.0000
        y: -300.0000
      - x: 900.0000
        y: -300.0000
      - x: 900.0000
        y: -1100.0000
```

**Illuminance sensor** - when enabled, the shade is driven dynamically by a lux sensor. Low lux approaches night shade; 300 lux reaches day shade; brighter reduces shade further. The sensor is selected from a searchable dropdown of all `sensor.*` and `input_number.*` entities. Falls back to `sun.sun` day/night when disabled or sensor is unavailable.

## Light Types (Positional Mode)

Each `light.*` marker in a Positional zone has a **Light type** that controls how the glow is rendered on floors, walls, and ceilings.

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Spot** | Ceiling downlight. Renders a cone on the wall with inner/outer angle, a bright floor hotspot, and GI bounce. Supports tilt X/Y to aim off-center. |
| **Cove** | Indirect ceiling bounce. Produces a top-heavy wall wash that fades downward and a soft uniform floor fill centered on the zone. |
| **Linear** | LED strip. Elongated floor pool; wall wash runs the length of the strip path. |
| **Lamp** | Floor or table lamp. Tight floor pool, soft wall glow radiating outward. |

Set **Light radius** to override the auto-computed pool size (in model units). Leave blank for automatic sizing based on mount height and zone dimensions.

### Light Paths (Linear / Cove)

Linear and Cove lights support a drawn path that distributes sample points along the strip:

- **Draw line** - click the 3D model to add path points one by one
- **Rectangle** - define width, depth, and rotation; the card generates a closed 4-corner loop automatically. The marker position becomes the rectangle center.

### Sub-spots (Spot)

A spot marker can contain multiple render-only sub-spots - extra light positions that share the parent entity state but each have their own XYZ position and render parameters. Useful for a single HA entity that controls a row of ceiling spots.

## Render Parameters

Every light marker has a full set of render parameters accessible in the **Advanced** section of the floating panel. Parameters are grouped into four sections:

### Core
| Param | Description |
|---|---|
| `intensity` | Overall brightness multiplier |
| `distance` | How far the light reaches - affects wall reach and floor pool size |
| `decay` | Falloff speed. Low = soft wide wash. High = sharp tight edge |

### Light Shape
| Param | Applies to | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `angle` | Spot | Cone half-angle in radians. Smaller = narrower beam |
| `penumbra` | Spot | Softness of cone edge. 0 = hard cut, 1 = fully feathered |
| `tilt_x` | Spot, Linear, Cove | Tilts the light in the X floor direction |
| `tilt_y` | Spot, Linear, Cove | Tilts the light up/down |
| `width` | Linear, Cove | Width of the rectangular light source |
| `height` | Linear, Cove | Height of the rectangular light source |

### Floor Pool
| Param | Description |
|---|---|
| `floor_hotspot_size` | Size of the bright core relative to the main pool. Most effective on Spot, Lamp |
| `floor_saturation` | Color saturation of the floor glow. 0 = grey, 1.5 = vivid |
| `floor_outer_size` | Radius multiplier of the wide ambient scatter layer |
| `floor_outer_brightness` | Brightness of the outer scatter layer |
| `gi_brightness` | GI bounce intensity - secondary soft floor fill. 0 = disabled |
| `gi_radius` | Radius multiplier of the GI bounce mesh |
| `gi_warmth` | Warms the GI bounce color to simulate warm floor reflection |

### Wall Glow
| Param | Description |
|---|---|
| `wall_intensity_scale` | Multiplier for overall wall glow brightness |
| `wall_height_limit` | Fraction of zone height the wall mesh covers. 1.0 = full wall |
| `wall_lower_bias` | Shifts glow center down the wall. 0 = near fixture, 1 = near floor |

Hovering over any parameter value shows a tooltip with a description and which light types it is most effective on.

### Presets

Parameter sets can be saved as named presets and reused across lights:

- **Save as preset** - prompts for a name and stores the current resolved values
- **Reset** - clears all per-light overrides and returns to type defaults
- **Export** - downloads the resolved parameters as a `.json` file
- **Import** - loads a previously exported `.json` and applies it to the current light

Presets are saved to `localStorage` and survive JavaScript file updates. The YAML export also includes the `light_presets:` block so they can be committed to the card config:

```yaml
light_presets:
  narrow_spot:
    angle: 0.25
    penumbra: 0.3
    wall_intensity_scale: 1.2
```

Per-light overrides and preset assignments export with the marker:

```yaml
markers:
  - entity: light.hallway_spot
    light_type: spot
    light_preset: narrow_spot
    render_params:
      tilt_x: 15
      wall_lower_bias: 0.2
    x: 500.0000
    y: 230.0000
    z: 400.0000
```

## Floor and Ceiling Glow Clipping

All floor pools, ceiling glows, and GI bounce meshes are clipped to the zone polygon boundary. Light cannot bleed through walls into adjacent rooms regardless of pool radius.

## Multiple Floors

```yaml
type: custom:home-assistant-3d-floorplan
title: Home Floorplan
view_mode: "3d"
floors:
  - id: ground
    name: Ground Floor
    model: /local/floorplans/ground-floor.glb
    markers: []
    brightness_zones: []
  - id: first
    name: First Floor
    model: /local/floorplans/first-floor.glb
    markers: []
    brightness_zones: []
```

## Floor Levels (Cutaway)

A Sims-style alternative to `floors:` above: instead of swapping to an entirely separate
model per floor (its own camera, markers, zones), this works on **one combined model** and
just hides floor groups above the level you select, from the same camera angle.

```yaml
floor_levels:
  - object_name: "GroundFloor"
    name: "Ground Floor"
    level: 0
  - object_name: "FirstFloor"
    name: "First Floor"
    level: 1
  - object_name: "Roof"
    name: "Roof"
    level: 2
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `object_name` | Yes | — | Name of the top-level mesh/empty group in the GLB containing that floor's geometry (as named in Blender) |
| `name` | No | `Floor {n}` | Button label shown on the card |
| `level` | No | `0` | Numeric level - higher levels are hidden first |

A column of buttons - one per configured level, highest floor listed first, like a
building directory - appears in the bottom-right of the 3D viewport whenever at least 2
distinct levels are configured. Clicking a floor hides every group whose `level` is above
it; clicking a higher floor reveals them again. Nothing is removed from the scene - groups
are just toggled `visible = false`.

**Blender workflow**: parent each floor's objects under one Empty (or a single top-level
mesh) per floor, then tag that top-level object with a floor level - see
`blender-ha-floorplan/README.md` in the esphome repo for the add-on side of this.

### Markers don't hide automatically - opt them in with `floor_level`

Unlike `animations:`/`interactive_objects:` (which reference a named GLB node and inherit
its parent's visibility automatically), a marker is positioned by a static `x`/`y`/`z` in
config, not tied to any scene-graph node - so a light or TV marker sitting inside a
cut-away floor keeps showing its icon/label by default, even though the floor's geometry
around it is hidden. Give a marker an explicit `floor_level` to opt it into the same
cutaway:

```yaml
markers:
  - entity: light.tv_backlight
    name: "TV"
    floor_level: 1
    x: -4.0704
    y: 4.2191
    z: 12.5354
```

`floor_level` is compared the same way as `floor_levels:` groups: the marker hides once
the visible level drops below it. Leave it unset (the default) and the marker always
shows, regardless of the cutaway state. The Blender add-on sets this automatically when
a marker object is parented under a tagged floor-level group - see its README.

### Tips

- Works with `floors:` too - each separate-model floor can have its own `floor_levels:` for
  a sub-cutaway within that floor's model, though this is a fairly niche combination.
- Requires at least 2 configured levels; with 0 or 1, no buttons render at all.
- `level` values don't need to be contiguous (0, 1, 2, ...) - any set of distinct numbers
  works, they're just sorted to build the button order (highest first).

## Offline / Three.js Setup

### What is and isn't local by default

When you install via HACS or manually, the card file (`Home-Assistant-3D-Floorplan.js`) is stored locally on your Home Assistant instance. Your `.glb` model is also served from your local `/www/` folder.

When installed through HACS, the card first loads the bundled Three.js build from the HACS-served files:

```yaml
three_bundle_urls:
  - /hacsfiles/Home-Assistant-3D-Floorplan/dist/three.bundle.min.js
  - /local/three.bundle.min.js
```

If those bundle paths are unavailable, the card falls back to the external CDN `esm.sh`:

```yaml
three_url: "https://esm.sh/three@0.165.0"   # default - requires internet
```

The bundled HACS path avoids remote-access and Companion App issues caused by blocked external module imports.

### Making it fully offline (recommended)

The repository includes a pre-built bundle at `dist/three.bundle.min.js`. Copy it to your Home Assistant `www` folder:

```
/config/www/three.bundle.min.js
```

Then point the card at it if you are not using HACS:

```yaml
type: custom:home-assistant-3d-floorplan
title: 3D Floorplan
model: /local/floorplans/home.glb
three_bundle_urls:
  - /local/three.bundle.min.js
```

With this in place, **everything runs 100% offline** - no external requests, no CDN dependency. This also fixes loading issues in the Home Assistant Companion App on iOS/Android, which can block remote module imports.

### Alternative - host individual Three.js files

If you prefer to host the individual modules rather than the bundle:

```yaml
three_url: /local/vendor/three/three.module.js
gltf_loader_url: /local/vendor/three/GLTFLoader.js
obj_loader_url: /local/vendor/three/OBJLoader.js
orbit_controls_url: /local/vendor/three/OrbitControls.js
```

Use matching files from Three.js release `0.165.0`.

## Animated 3D Objects

Animate mesh objects in your GLB model based on Home Assistant entity state. Name your objects in Blender (or your 3D editor), then reference them by name in the card config.

These settings can be managed from the Home Assistant visual card editor under **Animated 3D Objects**. Use **Configuration scope** to edit a single-floor card or a specific floor in a multi-floor card.

### Configuration

Add an `animations` array at the top level (single-floor) or inside each floor entry (multi-floor):

```yaml
type: custom:home-assistant-3d-floorplan
title: 3D Floorplan
model: /local/floorplans/home.glb
animations:
  - object_name: "CeilingFan"
    entity: fan.kitchen_ventilador_cocina
    type: rotate
    axis: y
    speed: 2.0
  - object_name: "Pump_PB"
    entity: binary_sensor.hcc_planta_baja_pump
    type: rotate
    axis: z
    speed: 1.0
```

Multi-floor example:

```yaml
floors:
  - id: ground
    name: Ground Floor
    model: /local/floorplans/ground.glb
    animations:
      - object_name: "WaterValve"
        entity: switch.water_valve
        type: oscillate
        axis: z
        speed: 0.5
        amplitude: 0.8
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `object_name` | Yes | — | Name of the mesh/object in the GLB file (as named in Blender) |
| `entity` | Yes | — | Home Assistant entity ID that controls the animation |
| `type` | No | `rotate` | Animation type: `rotate`, `oscillate`, `bob`, or `cover_position` |
| `axis` | No | `y` | Rotation/movement axis: `x`, `y`, or `z` |
| `speed` | No | `1.0` | `rotate`/`oscillate`/`bob` only. Speed multiplier (rotations/cycles per second) |
| `state_on` | No | `"on"` | `rotate`/`oscillate`/`bob` only. Entity state value that triggers the animation |
| `amplitude` | No | `0.5` | `rotate`/`oscillate`/`bob` only. For `oscillate`: max rotation in radians. For `bob`: max displacement in model units |
| `property` | No | `position` | `cover_position` only: `position` (offset along `axis`) or `scale` (scale factor along `axis`) |
| `closed_value` | No | `0` | `cover_position` only: the `property` value when the cover's `current_position` is 0 (closed) |
| `open_value` | No | `0.5` (`1` for `scale`) | `cover_position` only: the `property` value when `current_position` is 100 (open) |
| `transition_speed` | No | `2` | `cover_position` only: how quickly the object eases toward a new position when the cover moves (higher = snappier) |

### Animation Types

- **`rotate`** — Continuous rotation around the specified axis. Good for fans, turbines, pumps.
- **`oscillate`** — Rocks back and forth around the axis. Good for valves, pendulums, indicators.
- **`bob`** — Moves up and down (or along the specified axis). Good for floating indicators or pistons.
- **`cover_position`** — Continuously driven by a `cover.*` entity's `current_position` attribute (0-100) rather than a binary on/off state, and eases smoothly toward a new value whenever the cover moves instead of looping. Good for blinds, shades, garage doors, awnings — anything with a real open/closed position. Interpolates linearly between `closed_value` (at position 0) and `open_value` (at position 100), applied either as a position offset or a scale factor along `axis` depending on `property`. For a roller blind modeled as fabric that shrinks as it rolls up, use `property: scale` with `closed_value: 1` and `open_value` near `0`. For a panel that slides down a track, use `property: position` with `closed_value: 0` and `open_value` set to the travel distance (negative if "open" moves it in the negative axis direction). Covers without position support (no `current_position` attribute) fall back to their binary `open`/`closed` state.

### Tips

- The object name in the config must match the object name in your 3D file exactly (case-sensitive).
- Set the object's origin point in Blender to the desired center of rotation before exporting.
- For fans, place the origin at the center of the fan blades and use `type: rotate` with `axis: y`.
- Animations only run when the entity state matches `state_on`. When the state changes to anything else, the object stops in its current position. (`cover_position` is the exception — it's driven continuously by `current_position`, not `state_on`.)
- Multiple animations can target different objects in the same model.
- **Geometry centering**: The card automatically centers each animated mesh's geometry around its local origin before animating. This ensures rotation happens in-place even for models exported from Sweet Home 3D or other tools that bake world-space vertex positions.

### Note on Three.js Loading

The card loads Three.js from `esm.sh` by default, which rewrites bare import specifiers internally. This avoids the problem where `jsdelivr.net` CDN links for Three.js addons (GLTFLoader, OrbitControls) use bare `import "three"` specifiers that fail without a browser import map.

If your HA instance has no internet access, use the bundled offline approach (`three_bundle_url`) described in the installation section above.

## Interactive 3D Objects

Bind named meshes in your GLB model directly to Home Assistant entities. Clicking/tapping the 3D object fires an action (toggle, more-info, call-service), and the object's appearance can change based on entity state.

The visual card editor provides repeatable interactive-object and state-style controls, including tap/hold service actions. Use **Configuration scope** to edit a single-floor card or a specific floor in a multi-floor card.

### Configuration

Add an `interactive_objects` array at the top level or inside each floor:

```yaml
interactive_objects:
  - object_name: "CeilingFan"
    entity: fan.kitchen_ventilador_cocina
    tap_action: toggle
    hold_action: more-info
    state_styles:
      "on":
        color: "#81c784"
      "off":
        color: "#5f6570"
        opacity: 0.6
  - object_name: "GarageDoor"
    entity: cover.garage_door
    tap_action: more-info
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `object_name` | Yes | — | Name of the mesh/object in the GLB file |
| `entity` | Yes | — | Home Assistant entity ID |
| `tap_action` | No | `toggle` | Action on tap: `toggle`, `more-info`, `none`, or a call-service object |
| `hold_action` | No | `more-info` | Action on long press (650ms): `toggle`, `more-info`, `none`, or a call-service object |
| `state_styles` | No | — | Object mapping entity state values to visual styles |

### State Styles

Each key under `state_styles` is an entity state value. Supported style properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `color` | Hex color string to tint the object material (e.g. `"#ff0000"`) |
| `opacity` | Number 0–1, makes the object semi-transparent |

When the entity state changes to a value not listed in `state_styles`, the object reverts to its original material.

### Call-Service Action

For custom actions beyond toggle/more-info:

```yaml
interactive_objects:
  - object_name: "Thermostat"
    entity: climate.living_room
    tap_action:
      action: call-service
      service: climate.set_temperature
      data:
        temperature: 22
```

### Combining with Animations

An object can be both interactive AND animated. Use the same `object_name` in both arrays:

```yaml
animations:
  - object_name: "CeilingFan"
    entity: fan.kitchen
    type: rotate
    axis: y
    speed: 3.0

interactive_objects:
  - object_name: "CeilingFan"
    entity: fan.kitchen
    tap_action: toggle
    state_styles:
      "on":
        color: "#81c784"
      "off":
        color: "#5f6570"
```

This makes the fan spin when on AND lets you tap it to toggle, with a color tint indicating state.

### Tips

- The cursor changes to a pointer when hovering over interactive objects.
- Hold gesture uses the same duration as markers (`marker_hold_ms`, default 650ms).
- If the named object is a group/empty in Blender, all child meshes become clickable.
- State styles clone materials internally so shared materials on other objects are not affected.

## Performance Notes

- Use `.glb` format - single file, browser-optimised, carries geometry, materials, and textures together
- Zone polygon complexity affects floor pool rendering - simpler polygons with fewer vertices render faster
- Increase `light_radius` and reduce sample count for Linear/Cove lights covering large areas
- The GI bounce (`gi_brightness`) is disabled by default; enable only where the extra ambient fill is visible
